//"8*. Write a project named ""Remote Device"". Create a class ""RemoteController""
//which will be simulation the real one to control the TV. Create interfaces Device and Volume.
//The ""Device"" interface should have methods powerOn(), powerOff(), setChannel(int channel),
//and currentChannel();
//The ""Volume"" interface should have methods ""upVolume(), downVolume() and mute();
//Write an abstract class TVDevice which will be implementing interfaces Volume and Device and
//has the fields String modelName and boolean isOn (Tip: You don't need to implement methods from the interface
//if you class is abstract).
//Write a class ""TV"" which extends the class TVDevice. Implements all the methods.
//Write a class RemoteController to control your TV.
//Example of the structure in the requirements.
